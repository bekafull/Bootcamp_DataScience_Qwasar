# Welcome to Ds Quest03
***QWASAR Ds Quest03***

## Task
Remember to git add && git commit && git push each exercise!
We will execute your function with our test(s), please DO NOT PROVIDE ANY TEST(S) in your file

For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional
files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under 
submit directory and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of
each exercise under submit file(s).
## Description
In a computer science world, we can say: plotting is the debugging of data science! :-)

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical
mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into 
applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.
There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL),
designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged.[3] SciPy makes use of Matplotlib.
## Installation
Don't push my_plot_journey_histogram.png. If the image is present in your git, you will
be mark as fail on this exercise.First release in 2003. Written in Python.
Library matplotlib is very easy to use. You should find the right function to call within few google requests. ;-)
You will have to fill in the missing parts. Missing parts are marked as: ????.

Tip
Google: matplotlib :)
## Usage
Another form is Scatter graph.

A scatter plot (also called a scatterplot, scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram) is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data.
If the points are coded (color/shape/size), one additional variable can be displayed. The data are displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis.

Let's represent our data on a scatter plot. It should like this:
You will have to fill in the missing parts. Missing parts are marked as: ????.
